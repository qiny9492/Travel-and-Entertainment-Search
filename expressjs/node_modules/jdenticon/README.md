## Getting started
Using Jdenticon is simple. Follow the steps below to integrate Jdenticon into your website.

### 1. Add identicon placeholders
Jdenticon is able to render both raster and vector identicons. Raster icons are rendered 
slightly faster than vector icons, but vector icons scale better on high resolution screens.
Add a canvas to render a raster icon, and an inline svg element to render a vector icon.

```HTML
<!-- Vector icon -->
<svg width="80" height="80" data-jdenticon-value="icon value"></svg>

<!-- OR -->

<!-- Raster icon -->
<canvas width="80" height="80" data-jdenticon-value="icon value"></canvas>
```

Not sure about ```data-jdenticon-hash```? A hashed username works perfectly fine! Sensitive information 
is not recommended as input to the hash algorithm for this purpose.

### 2. Add reference to Jdenticon
Include the Jdenticon library somewhere on your page. You can either host it yourself or 
use it right off [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com).

```HTML
<!-- Using jsDelivr -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jdenticon@2.0.0"></script>

<!-- OR -->

<!-- Hosting it yourself -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="-path-to-/jdenticon.min.js"></script>
```
That's it!
